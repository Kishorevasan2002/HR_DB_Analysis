# HR Database Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **Human Resources (HR) database analysis**, simulating employee lifecycle data and performing analytical queries to uncover key organizational insights. The dataset is **synthetically generated using a Python script**, and stored in a **relational SQLite database** following a well-structured ER schema.

The analysis explores department performance, salary trends, employee attendance, and review metrics to support HR decision-making.
